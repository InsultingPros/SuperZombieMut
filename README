Install:
Copy the contents in the system folder to your Killing Floor system folder.

Usage:
Add the "Super Zombie" mutator to the list of active mutators.  The game 
will spawn the modified specimens in place of their default counterparts.
A configuration menu is available which allows users to select what 
specimens they wish to replace.  For dedicated servers, you should double 
check the wedadmin configuration page to make sure your desired specimens 
are active if it you are running the mutator for the first time.

To add the specimens in sandbox mode, you must add them to the monster 
class list.  The package name is "SuperZombie" and the specimens available 
are:

    ZombieSuperFP
    ZombieSuperBoss
    ZombieSuperGorefast
    ZombieSuperStalker
    ZombieSuperSiren
    ZombieSuperScrake
    ZombieSuperHusk
    ZombieSuperBloat

Shades are part of the default content and their package name is 
"KFChar.ZombieShade".

Debugging output is available for those who wish to check out the specimens
in more detail.  The "debugLogLevel" variable controls the ammount of 
logging that is reported back to the player.  Setting the variable to "0" 
will disable all logging and increasing the value will increase the amount 
of logging.
