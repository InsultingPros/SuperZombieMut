Install:
Copy the contents in the system folder to your Killing Floor system folder.

Usage:
Add the "Super Zombie" mutator to the list of active mutators.  The game 
will spawn the modified specimens in place of their default counterparts.
To add the specimens in sandbox mode, you must add them to the monster 
class list.  The package name is "SuperZombie" and the specimens available 
are:
    ZombieSuperFP
    ZombieSuperBoss
    ZombieSuperGorefast
    ZombieSuperStalker
    ZombieSuperSiren
    ZombieSuperScrake

Debugging output is available for those who wish to check out the specimens
in more detail.  The "debugLogLevel" variable controls the ammount of 
logging that is reported back to the player.  Setting the variable to "0" 
will disable all logging and increasing the value will increase the amount 
of logging.

Change Log:

Version 1.3
+ When the Siren is attacking a door, her scream will hit through all 
objects such as walls and the door.  The damage dealt is only 50% of 
the normal damage.
+ Scrake can only be stunned (actual stun, not flinch) once.  In addition, 
he will immediately break out of stun if he is hit with weak attack.

Version 1.2
+ Gorefast will always do the charging melee attack.  The minimum range 
that triggers his charge has been doubled to 1400 units.
+ Stalker has the charging melee ability of the gorefast.  Unlike the 
gorefast, the stalker will always stay moving.  A cooldown has been added 
so she will not use her quick strikes in rapid succession.

Version 1.1
+ If surrounded by 3 or more people when he needs to heal, he will shoot a 
point blank rocket instead of kneeling down before running away
+ The Patriarch will now automatically destroy any welded door in his path 
if he is escaping to heal

Version 1.0
+ Modified the fleshpound controller so that only attacking will reset the 
rage timer.  Breaking LOS or avoiding a frag will instead pause the timer.
